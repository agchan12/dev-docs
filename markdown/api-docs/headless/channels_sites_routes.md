* Will BigDesign and the sample app be available for this?



# Channels SDK

---

The Channel SDK is a set of [APIs](#channel-listings-api), [UI components, patterns](#big-design-ui-components), and [app frameworks](#app-framework) that provides developers with the ability to build integrations between BigCommerce and external sales channels. These external channels include a variety of types, including Point of Sale (POS), marketplaces, marketing, and social, and platforms, such as Facebook, Amazon, eBay, and CMS platforms, like WordPress.

Through these integrations, merchants can easily expand where they sell their product catalog online, driving increased revenue through expanded brand recognition, broader shopper reach, and greater merchandising opportunities.

With the Channel SDK, developers can quickly create an app that provides merchants with the ability to manage the full experience of selling a product on both BigCommerce and an external platform, from listing products to receiving orders to shipping. It also provides the ability to build apps that help merchants optimize their selling across channels, such as re-pricers, and other related services.

## Channels SDK Components

### Big Design UI components

These reusable components are built to be compatible with BigCommerce design guidelines & color palette, fully flexible, responsive, and accessible. They enable you to create an app that looks and feels native to BigCommerce, which ultimately is less disruptive to a merchant’s workflow, as they are familiar with the experience and navigating much of the app’s functionality. The UI components can be used for any app, not just Channels.

### Channel & Listing API

These API endpoints allow product data to be managed for specific channels and product listings, rather than just at the BigCommerce product catalog level. This includes overriding fields with different values, whether necessary for merchandising, external channel requirements, enabling a different language, or more.

## Building a Channel App

How you build your channel app will depend on what kind of platform / channel you are building for and the functionality that is required or desired. The key, high level steps you need to take are:

1. <a href="">Determine what kind of app you’ll be building</a>
2. <a href="">Decide what APIs, patterns, and UI components you’ll need</a>
3. <a href="">Build the app</a>

## Type of App

Each type of channel app will differ in how it’s built due to the different functionality and requirements needed as a result of:

* What type of channel it is?
* Will the app be in BigCommerce’s Channel Manager or the app marketplace?

The Channel SDK and BigCommerce support a variety of different types of channels, including (but not limited to):
